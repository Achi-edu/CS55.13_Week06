# Gamer Devs Example

This is a quick example app showing a basic nextjs app. I was having a nostalgic conversation this week with a coworker about old school game creators so I thought it would be a fitting way to come up with two data sources for use.

I knew a few of the names but had to look a lot of this up around the web. I also was really going down the rabbit hole on adding too much and then getting rushed at the end.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
